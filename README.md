# Multi-Agent-Autonomous-Agriculture-for-Precision-Farming

This Pygame-based simulation creates a virtual crop plantation with drones and tractors. Crops grow and mature over time, while weeds can also sprout and spread. The drone can perform tasks like watering and monitoring crops, while the tractor is responsible for harvesting mature crops and removing weeds. The time of day and temperature cycle dynamically, affecting crop growth rates. User input via the keyboard assigns tasks to the drone and tractor, providing an interactive element to the simulation.
